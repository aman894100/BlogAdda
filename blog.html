        <p class="font2"> In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert
            information—such as a letter,
            word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication through a
            communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is an invention of language, which
            enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard, or felt to others. But
            speech
            limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry and limits the audience to those present
            when
            the speech is uttered.
            The invention of writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of
            communication
            across space and time.

        <p class="font2">The process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or
            storage.
            Decoding is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands,
            such as English or/and Spanish.

            One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or written,
            is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or
            the
            arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters, and numbers. Another
            person
            standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.
